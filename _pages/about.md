I'm a first year Ph.D student in Computer Science at Dartmouth College, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Soroush Vosoughi. My current research interest
lies in various aspects of the interpretability of CV and NLP models. 
Beofre Dartmouth, I was a Master student in Statistical Science at Duke University. I was a memeber of Duke Interpretable Machine Learning Lab advised by Prof. Cynthia Rudin. Even before, I did my B.S. at Carnegie Mellon University majored in Statistics with concentration in Computational Finance, and I was working with 
Prof. Zach Branson on some statistical analysis applications in Biology field.
